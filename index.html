          <h3>WHY ISTANBUL</h3>
          <h4>Culture of Istanbul</h4>
          <p>
            The culture of Istanbul (Turkish: ƒ∞stanbul K√ºlt√ºr√º) has its basis in
            the city that has been the capital of the Byzantine and Ottoman
            Empires. However, when the Turkish Republic turned its focus away
            from Istanbul and toward Ankara, the city's cultural scene
            throughout the mid-20th century lay relatively stagnant, seeing
            limited success on the international, and even national, level. The
            government of the new republic established programs that served to
            engender Turks toward musical traditions originating in Europe, but
            musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were
            primarily centered in the new capital.[1] Although much of Turkey's
            culture had its roots in Istanbul, it was not until the 1980s and
            1990s that Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural
            significance is not solely based on its past glory.
