          <h3>WHY ISTANBUL</h3>
          <h4>Culture of Istanbul</h4>
          <p>
            The culture of Istanbul (Turkish: İstanbul Kültürü) has its basis in
            the city that has been the capital of the Byzantine and Ottoman
            Empires. However, when the Turkish Republic turned its focus away
            from Istanbul and toward Ankara, the city's cultural scene
            throughout the mid-20th century lay relatively stagnant, seeing
            limited success on the international, and even national, level. The
            government of the new republic established programs that served to
            engender Turks toward musical traditions originating in Europe, but
            musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were
            primarily centered in the new capital. Although much of Turkey's
            culture had its roots in Istanbul, it was not until the 1980s and
            1990s that Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural
            significance is not solely based on its past glory.

                <h4>Galata Tower</h4>
                <p>
                  The Galata Tower (Turkish: Galata Kulesi), officially the
                  Galata Tower Museum (Turkish: Galata Kulesi Müzesi), is an old
                  Genoese tower in the Galata part of the Beyoğlu district of
                  Istanbul, Turkey. Built as a watchtower at the highest point
                  of the (lost) Walls of Galata, the tower is now an exhibition
                  space and museum, and a symbol of Beyoğlu and Istanbul.

                <p>
                  The Maiden's Tower (Turkish: Kız Kulesi), also known as
                  Leander's Tower (Tower of Leandros) since the Byzantine
                  period, is a tower on a small islet at the southern entrance
                  of the Bosphorus strait, 200 m (220 yd) from the coast of
                  Üsküdar in Istanbul, Turkey. The tower appeared on the reverse
                  of the Turkish 10 lira banknote from 1966 to 1981.
